.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
drbdsetup is used to associate DRBD devices with their backing block devices, to set up DRBD device pairs to mirror their backing block devices, and to inspect the configuration of running DRBD devices\&.
.SH "NOTE"
.PP
drbdsetup is a low level tool of the DRBD program suite\&. It is used by the data disk and drbd scripts to communicate with the device driver\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
Each drbdsetup sub\-command might require arguments and bring its own set of options\&. All values have default units which might be overruled by K, M or G\&. These units are defined in the usual way (e\&.g\&. K = 2^10 = 1024)\&.
.SS "Common options"
.PP
All drbdsetup sub\-commands accept these two options
.PP
\fB\-\-create\-device\fR
.RS 4
In case the specified DRBD device (minor number) does not exist yet, create it implicitly\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-set\-defaults\fR
.RS 4
When
\fB\-\-set\-defaults\fR
is given on the command line, all options of the invoked sub\-command that are not explicitly set are reset to their default values\&.
.RE
.SS "disk"
.\" drbdsetup: disk
.PP
Associates
\fIdevice\fR
with
\fIlower_device\fR
to store its data blocks on\&. The
\fB\-d\fR
(or
\fB\-\-disk\-size\fR) should only be used if you wish not to use as much as possible from the backing block devices\&. If you do not use
\fB\-d\fR, the
\fIdevice\fR
is only ready for use as soon as it was connected to its peer once\&. (See the
\fBnet\fR
command\&.)
.PP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-disk\-size \fR\fB\fIsize\fR\fR
.RS 4
You can override DRBD\*(Aqs size determination method with this option\&. If you need to use the device before it was ever connected to its peer, use this option to pass the
\fIsize\fR
of the DRBD device to the driver\&. Default unit is sectors (1s = 512 bytes)\&.
.sp
If you use the
\fIsize\fR
parameter in drbd\&.conf, we strongly recommend to add an explicit unit postfix\&. drbdadm and drbdsetup used to have mismatching default units\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-on\-io\-error \fR\fB\fIerr_handler\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the driver of the
\fIlower_device\fR
reports an error to DRBD, DRBD will mark the disk as inconsistent, call a helper program, or detach the device from its backing storage and perform all further IO by requesting it from the peer\&. The valid
\fIerr_handlers\fR
are:
\fBpass_on\fR,
\fBcall\-local\-io\-error\fR
and
\fBdetach\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fencing \fR\fB\fIfencing_policy\fR\fR
.RS 4
Under
\fBfencing\fR
we understand preventive measures to avoid situations where both nodes are primary and disconnected (AKA split brain)\&.
.sp
Valid fencing policies are:
.PP
\fBdont\-care\fR
.RS 4
This is the default policy\&. No fencing actions are done\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBresource\-only\fR
.RS 4
If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it tries to outdate the peer\*(Aqs disk\&. This is done by calling the fence\-peer handler\&. The handler is supposed to reach the other node over alternative communication paths and call \*(Aqdrbdadm outdate res\*(Aq there\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBresource\-and\-stonith\fR
.RS 4
If a node becomes a disconnected primary, it freezes all its IO operations and calls its fence\-peer handler\&. The fence\-peer handler is supposed to reach the peer over alternative communication paths and call \*(Aqdrbdadm outdate res\*(Aq there\&. In case it cannot reach the peer, it should stonith the peer\&. IO is resumed as soon as the situation is resolved\&. In case your handler fails, you can resume IO with the
\fBresume\-io\fR
command\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-use\-bmbv\fR
.RS 4
In case the backing storage\*(Aqs driver has a merge_bvec_fn() function, DRBD has to pretend that it can only process IO requests in units not larger than 4 KiB\&. (At time of writing the only known drivers which have such a function are: md (software raid driver), dm (device mapper \- LVM) and DRBD itself)
.sp
To get best performance out of DRBD on top of software raid (or any other driver with a merge_bvec_fn() function) you might enable this option, if you know for sure that the merge_bvec_fn() function will deliver the same results on all nodes of your cluster\&. I\&.e\&. the physical disks of the software raid are exactly of the same type\&. USE THIS OPTION ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-no\-disk\-barrier\fR, \fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-no\-disk\-flushes\fR, \fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-no\-disk\-drain\fR
.RS 4
DRBD has four implementations to express write\-after\-write dependencies to its backing storage device\&. DRBD will use the first method that is supported by the backing storage device and that is not disabled by the user\&.
.sp
When selecting the method you should not only base your decision on the measurable performance\&. In case your backing storage device has a volatile write cache (plain disks, RAID of plain disks) you should use one of the first two\&. In case your backing storage device has battery\-backed write cache you may go with option 3 or 4\&. Option 4 will deliver the best performance such devices\&.
.sp
Unfortunately device mapper (LVM) might not support barriers\&.
.sp
The letter after "wo:" in /proc/drbd indicates with method is currently in use for a device: b, f, d, n\&. The implementations:
.PP
barrier
.RS 4
The first requires that the driver of the backing storage device support barriers (called \*(Aqtagged command queuing\*(Aq in SCSI and \*(Aqnative command queuing\*(Aq in SATA speak)\&. The use of this method can be disabled by the
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-barrier\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
flush
.RS 4
The second requires that the backing device support disk flushes (called \*(Aqforce unit access\*(Aq in the drive vendors speak)\&. The use of this method can be disabled using the
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-flushes\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
drain
.RS 4
The third method is simply to let write requests drain before write requests of a new reordering domain are issued\&. That was the only implementation before 8\&.0\&.9\&. You can prevent to use of this method by using the
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-drain\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
none
.RS 4
The fourth method is to not express write\-after\-write dependencies to the backing store at all\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-no\-md\-flushes\fR
.RS 4
Disables the use of disk flushes and barrier BIOs when accessing the meta data device\&. See the notes on
\fB\-\-no\-disk\-flushes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-max\-bio\-bvecs\fR
.RS 4
In some special circumstances the device mapper stack manages to pass BIOs to DRBD that violate the constraints that are set forth by DRBD\*(Aqs merge_bvec() function and which have more than one bvec\&. A known example is: phys\-disk \-> DRBD \-> LVM \-> Xen \-> missaligned partition (63) \-> DomU FS\&. Then you might see "bio would need to, but cannot, be split:" in the Dom0\*(Aqs kernel log\&.
.sp
The best workaround is to proper align the partition within the VM (E\&.g\&. start it at sector 1024)\&. That costs 480 KiB of storage\&. Unfortunately the default of most Linux partitioning tools is to start the first partition at an odd number (63)\&. Therefore most distributions install helpers for virtual linux machines will end up with missaligned partitions\&. The second best workaround is to limit DRBD\*(Aqs max bvecs per BIO (i\&.e\&., the
\fBmax\-bio\-bvecs\fR
option) to 1, but that might cost performance\&.
.sp
The default value of
\fBmax\-bio\-bvecs\fR
is 0, which means that there is no user imposed limitation\&.
.RE
.SS "net"
.\" drbdsetup: net
.PP
Sets up the
\fIdevice\fR
to listen on
\fIaf:local_addr:port\fR
for incoming connections and to try to connect to
\fIaf:remote_addr:port\fR\&. If
\fIport\fR
is omitted, 7788 is used as default\&. If
\fIaf\fR
is omitted
\fBipv4\fR
gets used\&. Other supported address families are
\fBipv6\fR,
\fBssocks\fR
for Dolphin Interconnect Solutions\*(Aq "super sockets" and
\fBsdp\fR
for Sockets Direct Protocol (Infiniband)\&.
.PP
On the TCP/IP link the specified
\fIprotocol\fR
is used\&. Valid protocol specifiers are A, B, and C\&.
.PP
Protocol A: write IO is reported as completed, if it has reached local disk and local TCP send buffer\&.
.PP
Protocol B: write IO is reported as completed, if it has reached local disk and remote buffer cache\&.
.PP
Protocol C: write IO is reported as completed, if it has reached both local and remote disk\&.
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-connect\-int \fR\fB\fItime\fR\fR
.RS 4
In case it is not possible to connect to the remote DRBD device immediately, DRBD keeps on trying to connect\&. With this option you can set the time between two retries\&. The default value is 10 seconds, the unit is 1 second\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ping\-int \fR\fB\fItime\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the TCP/IP connection linking a DRBD device pair is idle for more than
\fItime\fR
seconds, DRBD will generate a keep\-alive packet to check if its partner is still alive\&. The default value is 10 seconds, the unit is 1 second\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timeout \fR\fB\fIval\fR\fR
.RS 4
If the partner node fails to send an expected response packet within
\fIval\fR
tenths of a second, the partner node is considered dead and therefore the TCP/IP connection is abandoned\&. The default value is 60 (= 6 seconds)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sndbuf\-size \fR\fB\fIsize\fR\fR
.RS 4
The socket send buffer is used to store packets sent to the secondary node, which are not yet acknowledged (from a network point of view) by the secondary node\&. When using protocol A, it might be necessary to increase the size of this data structure in order to increase asynchronicity between primary and secondary nodes\&. But keep in mind that more asynchronicity is synonymous with more data loss in the case of a primary node failure\&. Since 8\&.0\&.13 resp\&. 8\&.2\&.7 setting the
\fIsize\fR
value to 0 means that the kernel should autotune this\&. The default
\fIsize\fR
is 0, i\&.e\&. autotune\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rcvbuf\-size \fR\fB\fIsize\fR\fR
.RS 4
Packets received from the network are stored in the socket receive buffer first\&. From there they are consumed by DRBD\&. Before 8\&.3\&.2 the receive buffer\*(Aqs size was always set to the size of the socket send buffer\&. Since 8\&.3\&.2 they can be tuned independently\&. A value of 0 means that the kernel should autotune this\&. The default
\fIsize\fR
is 0, i\&.e\&. autotune\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-ko\-count \fR\fB\fIcount\fR\fR

In case the secondary node fails to complete a single write request for
\fIcount\fR
times the
\fItimeout\fR, it is expelled from the cluster, i\&.e\&. the primary node goes into StandAlone mode\&. The default is 0, which disables this feature\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-max\-epoch\-size \fR\fB\fIval\fR\fR
.RS 4
With this option the maximal number of write requests between two barriers is limited\&. Should be set to the same as

By default DRBD blocks when the available TCP send queue becomes full\&. That means it will slow down the application that generates the write requests that cause DRBD to send more data down that TCP connection\&.
.sp
When DRBD is deployed with DRBD\-proxy it might be more desirable that DRBD goes into AHEAD/BEHIND mode shortly before the send queue becomes full\&. In AHEAD/BEHIND mode DRBD does no longer replicate data, but still keeps the connection open\&.
.sp
The advantage of the AHEAD/BEHIND mode is that the application is not slowed down, even if DRBD\-proxy\*(Aqs buffer is not sufficient to buffer all write requests\&. The downside is that the peer node falls behind, and that a resync will be necessary to bring it back into sync\&. During that resync the peer node will have an inconsistent disk\&.

DRBD automatically performs hot area detection\&. With this parameter you control how big the hot area (=active set) can get\&. Each extent marks 4M of the backing storage\&.

This setting is useful for DRBD setups with low bandwidth links\&. During the restart of a crashed primary node, all blocks covered by the activity log are marked for resync\&. But a large part of those will actually be still in sync, therefore using

During resync\-handshake, the dirty\-bitmaps of the nodes are exchanged and merged (using bit\-or), so the nodes will have the same understanding of which blocks are dirty\&. On large devices, the fine grained dirty\-bitmap can become large as well, and the bitmap exchange can take quite some time on low\-bandwidth links\&.
.sp
Because the bitmap typically contains compact areas where all bits are unset (clean) or set (dirty), a simple run\-length encoding scheme can considerably reduce the network traffic necessary for the bitmap exchange\&.

For backward compatibilty reasons, and because on fast links this possibly does not improve transfer time but consumes cpu cycles, this defaults to off\&.
